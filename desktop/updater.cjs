// WHICH package names this client accepts as ITS OWN update payload, and why that is a list.
//
// Owen, 2026-10-29: "you mean easter-server-client lol?" - the package really is misnamed. It
// cannot be renamed in one edit, and the reason is the machines already in the field, not caution:
// every published build (1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2) carries a guard that compares the DOWNLOADED
// payload's package.json name to the OLD literal, so a renamed payload is refused by every install
// that exists - the app keeps working and silently stops updating forever. That is the worst
// failure shape there is, so the rename takes three releases:
//   * 1.0.3 keeps PUBLISHING the old name, and both guards accept EITHER name. This build.
//   * 1.0.4 publishes the new name. Only an install that passed through 1.0.3 can read it.
//   * 1.0.5 is the earliest release that may DROP the old name from this list - and only after
//     every install that can auto-update has been through 1.0.3, because releases/latest is the
//     only address an old app ever consults: a machine that missed 1.0.3 will be handed the
//     renamed payload and refuse it, and needs a manual reinstall rather than a cleverer guard.
//
// The unguarded alternative - accepting any name, or any version - is not available: this is the
// check that stops a foreign asar being installed as this app.

//     announces nothing. A background stage that wrote `current.json` would make a minor
//     release activate on the next ordinary start *without* the clear its level asks for,
//     because bootstrap would then load the new bundle and the startup gate would find
//     nothing newer. So the staged record is a fact about the stash, not an activation.
